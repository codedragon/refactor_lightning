# Refactoring Lengthy Bits of Code

## Maria Mckinley



## Step 1

Write out in prose what is happening in the function/block of code that you want to refactor.

_We are opening up a window, setting the resolution, and opening up a second window. Then we are setting other properties for the window(s)(?), lens and camera_<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

_Wait a minute, why are we doing that?_<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->




## Step 2

Make an outline. Yes, old-fashioned outline like your English teacher made you write before you could start your essay.

_Sample Outline_<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

1. Open both Windows
   a. set resolution
2. Set Properties
   a. window
   b. lens
   c. camera



## Step 3 

_Notice that the outline may not make sense._<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

_Play around with outline until it actually makes sense._<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

_Subpoints may not be necessary to outline._<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

_Sample Outline 2_<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

1. Open both Windows
2. Set Window properties
3. Set Lens Properties
4. Set Camera Properties



## Step 4

Your main bullet points are your new function calls.

Everything else goes in one of these calls.



## Step 5

Write a test for each of your new functions!
